Substrate X Theory of Information Gravity (SXC-IGC)
Overview

Substrate X Theory (SXC) is a unified framework linking gravity, quantum mechanics, consciousness, and cosmology through the dynamics of a fundamental information-carrying substrate. The theory proposes that all physical and informational phenomena emerge from structured flow dynamics within this substrate.

The SXC-IGC Engine (Version 12) provides computational tools for simulating, testing, and validating the predictions of the theory.

Theory Structure

The framework unfolds in seven phases:

Foundation Layers

Physical Foundation

Leak-flow mechanics and energy propagation.

Core prediction: quantum decoherence rate depends on rotational dynamics:

Γ=Γ0+kω2
Γ=Γ
0
	​

+kω
2

where 
Γ
Γ is the decoherence rate, 
ω
ω is the angular velocity, and 
k
k is a substrate-specific constant.

Dimensional Framework

2D ↔ 3D ↔ 4D transitions and compression.

Governs emergent spatial properties and topology.

Matter Formation

Flow condensation mechanisms leading to particle emergence.

Predictive models for elementary particle mass distributions and interactions.

Extended Realms

Consciousness Layer

Interaction of substrate flows with neural and cognitive structures.

Models of “soul energy” coupling to neural network dynamics.

Cosmological Cascade

Galactic-scale flow patterns, black hole dynamics, and structure formation.

Predictive simulations of large-scale matter distribution and event horizons.

Experimental Framework

Verification tests for theoretical predictions.

Includes rotation-induced decoherence experiments and substrate flow monitoring.

Unified Paradigm

Philosophical synthesis and flow monism.

Integration of physical, conscious, and cosmological models into a unified framework.

Current Status

Phase 1 (Physical Foundation): Active development.

Phase 2–7: Conceptual definition; computational models under design.

Experimental Validation: Rotation-induced decoherence tests are proposed and planned for Phase 1.

Core Prediction

Quantum decoherence increases with rotational velocity squared:

Γ=Γ0+kω2
Γ=Γ
0
	​

+kω
2

This scaling law (
α=1.254) and the saturation bound (
1.5) are central to SXC-IGC simulations.
