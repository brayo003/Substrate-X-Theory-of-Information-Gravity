# The Book of Substrate X

*A Unified Theory of Reality Through Information Flow*

## Overview
This book presents Substrate X Theory - a complete framework unifying gravity, quantum mechanics, consciousness, and cosmology through the dynamics of a fundamental information-carrying substrate.

## Structure
The theory unfolds across seven phases:

### 🏗️ Foundation Layers
- **Phase 1**: Physical Foundation - Leak-flow mechanics & energy propagation
- **Phase 2**: Dimensional Framework - 2D↔3D↔4D transitions & compression
- **Phase 3**: Matter Formation - Flow condensation & particle emergence

### 🌌 Extended Realms  
- **Phase 4**: Consciousness Layer - Soul energy & neural interaction
- **Phase 5**: Cosmological Cascade - Galactic flows & black hole dynamics
- **Phase 6**: Experimental Framework - Verification tests & applications
- **Phase 7**: Unified Paradigm - Flow monism & philosophical synthesis

## Current Status
**Phase 1**: Active Development  
**Experimental Validation**: Rotation-induced decoherence test proposed

## Quick Start
- Begin with `phase-1-physical-foundation/` for core physics
- Check `references/` for related research
- Use `templates/` for consistent documentation

## Core Prediction
`Γ = Γ₀ + kω²` - Quantum decoherence increases with rotation rate squared
