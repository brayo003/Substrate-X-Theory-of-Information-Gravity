Substrate X Theory of Information Gravity (SXC-IGC)
Overview

Substrate X Theory (SXC) is a unified theoretical framework linking gravity, quantum mechanics, consciousness, and cosmology through the dynamics of a fundamental information-carrying substrate. All physical and informational phenomena are modeled as emergent consequences of structured flow dynamics governed by nonlinear instability laws.

The SXC-IGC Engine (Version 12) provides deterministic computational machinery for simulating, testing, and validating these dynamics across domains.

Core Mathematical Instance (Version 12)

All validated domains in SXC-IGC reduce to the V12 instability equation:

dxdt=rx+ax2−bx3
dt
dx
	​

=rx+ax
2
−bx
3

with a hard saturation bound:

x≤1.5
x≤1.5

and empirically stabilized scaling exponent:

α=1.254
α=1.254

This mathematical instance is the primary discovery of the SXC-IGC framework and constitutes its unifying engine.

Theory Structure

The framework is organized into seven phases.

Foundation Layers

Phase 1 — Physical Foundation
Leak-flow mechanics and energy propagation within the substrate.
Primary testable prediction:

Γ=Γ0+kω2
Γ=Γ
0
	​

+kω
2

where:

Γ
Γ is the quantum decoherence rate

ω
ω is angular velocity

k
k is a substrate-specific coupling constant

Phase 2 — Dimensional Framework
2D ↔ 3D ↔ 4D compression and transition rules governing emergent spatial topology.

Phase 3 — Matter Formation
Flow condensation regimes producing particle-like stability wells and interaction structure.

Extended Realms

Phase 4 — Consciousness Layer
Coupling between substrate flow fields and neural dynamics. Consciousness modeled as structured metastable flow coherence.

Phase 5 — Cosmological Cascade
Galaxy-scale and black-hole-scale flow regimes derived from the same instability law.

Phase 6 — Experimental Framework
Rotation-induced decoherence tests, RG-flow stability probes, and domain-specific validation suites.

Phase 7 — Unified Paradigm
Flow monism: a single dynamical substrate underlying physical, cognitive, and cosmological phenomena.

Current Status

Phase 1: Active development and numerical validation

Phases 2–7: Formally defined; domain modules under construction

Experimental Validation: Rotation-induced decoherence test specified for Phase 1
