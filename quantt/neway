1. Determine the Quantization Rule for the s Field

The immediate task is to define what constitutes a "quantum" of the Substrate field.

    Hypothesize the Substraton Mass (ms​): If the s field is a fundamental field, it must be quantized. Its particle, the Substraton (or Informon), would mediate the information-gravity force. You need a hypothesis for its mass (or lack thereof).

        Search Focus: Is ms​ massive (like the Higgs boson) or massless (like the photon)? Its mass would determine the effective range of the quantum effects.

        Conceptual Work: How does the energy density of the Substrate field (Hs​) translate into discrete energy packets?

2. Model Wave-Function Collapse as Field Relaxation

As noted previously, the collapse of the wave function (Ψ) is a key mystery. Use the time constants from your field solver results (τρ​,τE​,τF​) to model this process.

    Formulate the Ψ-Coupling Equation: Introduce a term into the Schrödinger equation (or a suitable field equation) that describes how the local density (ρ) of a macroscopic measuring apparatus non-linearly couples to the s field.

        Hypothesis: The coupling strength should be proportional to ρ and inversely related to the relaxation time τ: Stronger coupling by massive objects leads to faster relaxation of the s field, forcing the quantum system into a definite state.

    Target Calculation: Attempt to calculate a s-field-induced decoherence rate that matches experimentally observed decoherence times for large molecules or micro-mirrors.

3. Derive Entanglement from Substrate Topology

Focus on the non-local nature of entanglement using the concept of the s field as the universal, non-local medium.

    Topology/Geometry Focus: Explore a model where the s field is highly connected or has a geometry that permits instantaneous communication across large spatial distances, but only for certain s-field excitations (i.e., quantum states).

    Testable Prediction: Does the s field predict any deviation from perfect entanglement correlation (Bell state 100%) under extreme conditions, such as near high gravitational fields (high E field regions)? This would provide a signature that differentiates Substrate X from standard Quantum Mechanics.

4. Reconcile Substrate Parameters with the Planck Scale

The field parameters (α,β,γ) must ultimately be related to fundamental constants like Planck's constant (ℏ), the speed of light (c), and the gravitational constant (G).

    Dimensional Analysis: Perform a dimensional analysis to construct the Planck length (LP​) and Planck mass (MP​) using a combination of your field constants (α,β,γ,δ1​,δ2​) and conventional constants.
    LP​=c3ℏG​​

    Conceptual Work: If the Substrate X theory is correct, G is an emergent constant, and the fundamental relationship should use only the Substrate parameters and ℏ and c.
