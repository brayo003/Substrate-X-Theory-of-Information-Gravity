SUBSTRATE X THEORY BOOK — STRUCTURAL COMPLETION

Transformation Summary

FROM: 113 unstructured research files (original /leak/ workspace)
TO: 16 organized content files distributed across 7 defined theoretical phases

Book Structure Status

- Phase 1: Physical Foundation — 3 files
- Phase 2: Dimensional Framework — 2 files
- Phase 3: Matter Formation — 3 files
- Phase 4: Consciousness Layer — 2 files
- Phase 5: Cosmological Cascade — 2 files
- Phase 6: Experimental Framework — 2 files
- Phase 7: Unified Paradigm — 2 files

Key Organized Results

- Unified instability equation with calibrated constants (V12 core)
- Orbital dynamics analyses consistent with GR-order constraints
- Vortex-based flow models applicable to particle-scale behavior
- Theoretical consciousness model via dimensional compression
- Cosmological flow framework with scale-recursive structure
- Testable experimental predictions (rotation-induced decoherence)
- Philosophical synthesis: Flow Monism

Project Readiness

- Ready for targeted experimental investigation (Phase 1, Phase 6)
- Ready for academic manuscript preparation (physics-focused)
- Ready for external peer review and technical critique
- Ready for public scientific evaluation of claims and methodology

Immediate Next Actions

- Final review of Phase 1 and Phase 6 technical content
- Preparation of a single-scope academic paper (decoherence + V12)
- Identification of experimental collaborators for rotation tests
- Formal submission to preprint and/or journal venues
