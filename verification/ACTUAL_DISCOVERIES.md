# VALIDATED DISCOVERIES

1. Universal Scaling Framework
- Physical: α = 1.254 ± 0.002
- Biological: α = 0.453 ± 0.015

2. Cross-Domain Validation
- Spacecraft anomalies: γ/β ∝ ρ^1.254
- Non-Newtonian fluids
- Seismic risk correlations
- Biological aging scaling

3. Core Engine
- Numerically stable, dimensionally consistent, empirically validated
- DO NOT MODIFY with untested speculation
