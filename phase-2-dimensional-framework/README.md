# Phase 2: Dimensional Framework

## Overview
Explores how Substrate X behaves across different dimensional scales - from 2D surface dynamics to 3D bulk properties and 4D spacetime emergence. This phase explains why reality appears 3D+time while being fundamentally interconnected across dimensions.

## Directory Structure

### 2.1 Dimensional Transitions
**Rules governing 2D↔3D↔4D interactions**
- How substrate flows transition between dimensional layers
- Interface dynamics and boundary conditions
- Scale-dependent emergence of spatial dimensions

### 2.2 Compression & Expansion  
**Dimensional phase changes in substrate**
- Energy density thresholds for dimensional shifts
- Information packing limits and dimensional saturation
- Cosmic-scale expansion/contraction mechanisms

### 2.3 Energy Layering
**Multi-scale organization of substrate**
- Hierarchical flow patterns across dimensions
- Dimensional resonance and standing waves
- Energy distribution across dimensional interfaces

### Experiments
**Testing dimensional predictions**
- Substrate behavior at different scale thresholds
- Dimensional transition detection methods
- Cross-dimensional information transfer tests

## Current Status
- **Theoretical Framework**: Under development
- **Mathematical Formalism**: In progress
- **Experimental Design**: Planning phase
- **Connection to Phase 1**: Being established
