PROJECT GOAL (LOCKED)

The project is Domain-Calibrated Instability Framework (DCIF).

Core principles:

Fixed mathematical structure

Domain-specific calibration

Explicit signal definitions

Zero hidden normalization

Zero universal constants

Full reproducibility

Any output that violates these principles is invalid.

2. DEFINITION OF “COMPLETE” (ENFORCED)

A module is NOT COMPLETE unless it contains ALL of the following:

/<module_name>/
├── signals.py                  # Explicit ρ, E, F definitions
├── normalization.py            # All scaling logic, isolated
├── data_generator.py           # Synthetic or real data source
├── calibrate.py                # Uses calibration_engine ONLY
├── coefficients.json           # α, β, γ + metadata
├── validation_report.md        # Out-of-sample + failure modes
├── README.md                   # Domain, assumptions, limits
└── __init__.py


If you generate fewer files, you have failed.

3. CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)

All code must:

Be modular

Be testable

Separate concerns cleanly

Contain docstrings explaining why, not just what

Avoid magic numbers

Avoid inline normalization

Avoid hardcoded coefficients unless loaded from artifacts

If any logic is “implied” instead of explicit, that is a failure.

4. CALIBRATION RULES (ABSOLUTE)

Calibration MUST use calibration_engine

Targets MUST be human-defined

Coefficients MUST be saved to disk

Calibration MUST be reproducible

No runtime coefficient fitting inside analyzers

Analyzers consume coefficients.
They do not invent them.

5. OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)

When asked to build or modify a module:

First output: Directory tree

Second output: Purpose of each file

Third output: Full contents of each file

Fourth output: Explanation of how this satisfies DCIF

If any step is skipped, the response is invalid.

6. PROHIBITED BEHAVIOR

You are explicitly forbidden from:

Producing “starter”, “example”, or “simplified” code

Producing single-file modules

Hiding logic inside notebooks

Using vague placeholders like “TODO”

Assuming future expansion instead of implementing it

If the implementation is not ready to accept community contribution, it is incomplete.

7. VALIDATION EXPECTATION

Every module must include:

At least two target regimes

At least one out-of-sample validation

A written failure analysis

No validation → no module.

8. INTERACTION RULE

If the specification is insufficient:

You must state what is missing

You must refuse to generate code

You must request clarification

You are not allowed to guess silently.

9. PHILOSOPHICAL CONSTRAINT

This framework values:

Honesty over ambition

Structure over cleverness

Reproducibility over novelty

If a choice trades correctness for elegance, correctness wins.

10. ACCEPTANCE CONDITION

Before finishing any response, you must internally verify:

“Could an external contributor use this without asking questions?”

If the answer is no, the output is unacceptable.
