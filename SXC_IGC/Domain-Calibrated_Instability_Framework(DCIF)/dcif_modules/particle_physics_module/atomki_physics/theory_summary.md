## Protophobic X17 Coupling Logic
To explain why the anomaly appears in both 8Be (Proton+Neutron) and 12C (Proton+Neutron) 
but is restricted by Pi0 decay limits, the coupling g_p (proton) and g_n (neutron) 
must follow:
- |g_p + g_n| ≈ 0.011 (for 8Be)
- |g_p| < 1.2e-3 (Protophobic limit)

This implies X17 couples primarily to Neutrons.
