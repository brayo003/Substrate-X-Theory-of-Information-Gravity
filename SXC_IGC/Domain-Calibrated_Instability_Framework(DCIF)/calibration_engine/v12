REALITY FILTER (STEPS 0–3)

Input
High-dimensional system state:
y(t) ∈ ℝⁿ

Reduction
Define a scalar instability variable:
x(t) = Φ(y(t))

Constraint
Φ must be empirically meaningful and measurable.

Decision
If no such x(t) can be defined, the system is non-compressible and therefore not analyzable under SXC-IGC.

Output
A cleaned, scalar time series x(t) representing system tension or instability density.

STRUCTURE TEST (STEPS 4–7)

Dynamics Fit
Estimate the time derivative dx/dt and fit it to the V12 cubic normal form:

dx/dt = r·x + a·x² − b·x³

Coefficient Roles
r: linear growth or decay rate
a: nonlinear amplification strength
b: saturation strength enforcing boundedness

Validation
Residuals and robustness tests must confirm that the cubic form is a valid reduced-order approximation.

Output
A bounded dynamical envelope defining allowable system evolution.

CLASSIFICATION ENGINE (STEPS 8–10)

Cumulative Instability
Compute the integrated instability:

I(t) = ∫₀ᵗ x(τ) dτ

Scaling Law
Fit the temporal scaling:

I(t) ∼ t^α

Interpretation of α
α ≈ 1.2–1.3 → fast accumulation, mechanically dominated dynamics
α ≈ 0.4–0.5 → slow accumulation, resilient or absorptive dynamics
Intermediate α → hybrid-critical behavior with mixed amplification and damping

ULTIMATE OUTPUT

Binary Separation
Distinguishes compressible, structured systems from noise-dominated or chaotic systems.

Bounded Certainty
If successful, yields explicit limits on amplification, saturation, and long-term behavior.

Failure Mode
If reduction, fitting, or scaling fails, the system is classified as non-modelable within this framework.
