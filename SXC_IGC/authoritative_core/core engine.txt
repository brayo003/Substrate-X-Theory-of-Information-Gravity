                 SYSTEM EXCITATION COORDINATE - INSTABILITY GROWTH CLASS

 SXC-IGC Engine )

1. State Variable

xₜ

Scalar system tension / informational strain / instability density.

Dimensionless after normalization.

Must be signed. Zero is not a safe state.

Interpretation:

x ≈ 0 → metastable calm (linearly unstable for r > 0)
x > 0 → amplifying stress
x < 0 → dissipative relaxation

2. Time Discretization

Δt

Fixed integration step.

Controls numerical stability, not physical dynamics.

Constraint:

Δt ≪ min(1 / characteristic growth rate)

Explicit numerical condition:

Δt · max |f′(x)| < 1 over the explored state range.

Chosen value:

Δt = 0.05 (stable for |x| = O(1) and r ≈ 0.15)

3. Deterministic Core (Drift)

General update rule:

xₜ₊₁ = xₜ + Δt · f(xₜ)

with drift function:

f(x) = r x + a x² − b x³

All terms are required.

(a) Linear Growth Rate

r

Baseline amplification coefficient.

Encodes background instability of the substrate.

r > 0 → latent runaway exists
r < 0 → trivial decay, no tipping behavior

Typical regime:

0 < r ≲ 0.3

Instance:

r = 0.153267

(b) Quadratic Feedback (Asymmetry / Bias)

a

Breaks x ↔ −x symmetry.

Represents directional bias in accumulation.

Controls skew of the effective potential.

Interpretation:

a > 0 → tension self-reinforces once present
a = 0 → symmetric pitchfork bifurcation
a < 0 → self-correcting bias

Instance:

a = 1.0

(c) Cubic Saturation (Hard Constraint)

b

Enforces boundedness.

Represents structural limits of the substrate.

Interpretation:

b > 0 → physical saturation ceiling
b too small → artificial divergence
b too large → overdamped suppression

Instance:

b = 1.0

4. Stochastic Forcing

ηₜ

Additive zero-mean noise term.

Models unresolved micro-fluctuations.

Noise model:

ηₜ ∼ 𝒩(0, σ²)

σ controls tipping probability, not equilibrium location.

Constraint:

σ ≪ Δt · max |f(x)| within the metastable basin.

Multiplicative noise is excluded to preserve statistical validity.

5. Fixed Points (Structural Skeleton)

Equilibria satisfy:

f(x) = r x + a x² − b x³ = 0

Factorization:

x ( r + a x − b x² ) = 0

Solutions:

x₀ = 0

x± = ( a ± √(a² + 4 b r) ) / (2 b)

Interpretation:

One trivial equilibrium.
Two nontrivial branches (one stable, one unstable).

6. Stability Classification

Stability is determined by:

f′(x) = r + 2 a x − 3 b x²

At x = 0:

Stable if r < 0
Unstable if r > 0 (current regime)

At x = x±:

One branch satisfies f′(x) < 0 → stable attractor
The other satisfies f′(x) > 0 → unstable repeller

Tipping occurs via stochastic escape or slow parameter drift.

7. Control Parameters (Meta-Layer)

These parameters modify experiments, not physics:

• Parameter drift: r(t), a(t), b(t)
• Noise scheduling: σ(t)
• Boundary policy: reflecting vs absorbing caps
• Initialization ensemble: distribution of x₀

8. Valid Operating Regime

The model is physically interpretable only when:

r > 0
a ≠ 0
b > 0
σ small but nonzero
Δt stable under Euler integration

Outside this regime, the model loses physical interpretability.

9. Minimal Canonical Instance

xₜ₊₁ = xₜ + 0.05 ( 0.153267 xₜ + xₜ² − xₜ³ ) + ηₜ

This fully specifies the SXC-IGC engine.
