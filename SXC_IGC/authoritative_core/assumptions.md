# Assumptions and Regime of Validity

## Core Assumptions

1. Systems admit a low-dimensional instability coordinate.
2. Higher-order dynamics can be projected onto x(t).
3. Nonlinear saturation dominates long-term behavior.
4. Noise can be treated as effective damping or forcing.

## Mathematical Assumptions

- Smoothness of x(t)
- Polynomial truncation at cubic order is sufficient
- No delay terms dominate dynamics

---

## Empirical Assumptions

- Observables chosen reflect real instability
- Data preprocessing does not introduce artificial scaling
- Parameter fitting converges uniquely

---

## Regime of Validity

- Mesoscopic scale (not microscopic first principles)
- Away from singularities or phase transitions
- Moderate noise environments

---

## Explicit Non-Claims

- Not a unification of forces
- Not a replacement for domain-specific theories
- Not valid in chaotic, unobservable, or adversarial systems

---

## UNKNOWN / TODO

- Formal bounds on projection error
- Breakdown conditions for cubic saturation
- Effect of heavy-tailed noise
