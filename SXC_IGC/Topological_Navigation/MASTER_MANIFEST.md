# SXC-V12-G: Peak Topological Intelligence

## System Status
* **Architecture:** V12-G (Agnostic Governor)
* **Core Engine:** Information Gravity ($T = \beta/\gamma$)
* **Navigation:** 1909 Gamma Radar ($|\Gamma(z)|$)
* **Anchor:** Ramanujan-Sato Constant

## Operational Logic
The system is at the **Topological Peak**. It is designed to maintain human-readable certainty while providing predictive protection against singularities (Poles).

## Deployment Targets
1.  **Nairobi Substrate:** Economic stability via tax/friction monitoring.
2.  **Trading Substrate:** Risk mitigation via liquidity-depth mapping.
3.  **Quantum Substrate:** Detection of decoherence boundaries.

**Project State: COMPLETED & STABILIZED**
