Universal Multi-Domain Engine (UMDE)
Reader Orientation and Scope Control

This document specifies the architecture of the Universal Multi-Domain Engine (UMDE). It does not include theories of consciousness, intelligence, agency, or meaning.

The UMDE is an execution framework for a fixed set of dynamical equations (SXC–IGC). Its purpose is to apply these equations consistently across domains without contamination by domain-specific assumptions, control logic, or narrative interpretation.

What This Document Is

    A formal architectural specification

    A separation-of-concerns contract

    A numerical safety and stability design

    A cross-domain execution framework

What This Document Is Not

    A phenomenological theory

    A cognitive or psychological model

    A metaphysical proposal

    An assertion of subjective experience

    A claim about consciousness

Why This Architecture Exists

Cross-domain modeling failures are usually caused by:

    Domain logic leaking into core equations.

    Control mechanisms overriding physical dynamics.

    Narrative interpretation preceding validation.

UMDE enforces protection against all three.
How to Read This Document

    Layer 1 represents immutable law.

    Layer 2 represents constrained mapping, not interpretation.

    Layer 3 represents operational safety, not intelligence.

    Emergent behavior is descriptive, not explanatory.

Epistemic Boundary

All claims must be traceable to:

    An equation

    A parameter field

    A monitored metric

The engine produces dynamics.

Interpretation is external.

Meaning is not computed.
