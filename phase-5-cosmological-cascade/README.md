# Phase 5: Cosmological Cascade

## Overview
Scales Substrate X Theory to cosmic dimensions - explaining galactic structures, black hole dynamics, dark energy, and the large-scale evolution of the universe as cascading flow patterns in the universal substrate. This phase connects quantum-scale physics to cosmic-scale phenomena.

## Directory Structure

### 5.1 Galactic Flows
**Large-scale structure formation**
- Spiral arms as substrate flow patterns
- Dark matter as substrate density gradients
- Galactic evolution and merger dynamics

### 5.2 Black Hole Leaks  
**Event horizons and information paradox**
- Black holes as ultimate leak sources
- Information preservation through substrate
- Hawking radiation as modified flow dynamics

### 5.3 Energy Recycling
**Cosmic-scale conservation and renewal**
- Vacuum energy replenishment mechanisms
- Cosmic inflation as substrate expansion
- Eternal universe through energy cycling

### Experiments
**Cosmological observations and tests**
- Galactic rotation curve predictions
- Black hole information paradox resolution
- Cosmic microwave background analysis

## Current Status
- **Theoretical Development**: Early conceptual stage
- **Mathematical Scaling**: Pending Phase 1 completion
- **Observational Predictions**: Being formulated
- **Connection to Standard Cosmology**: Mapping in progress
