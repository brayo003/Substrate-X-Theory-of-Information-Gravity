# Mathematical Derivations

## Master Equation
**First-principles derivation**: See `master-equation-first-principles.md`

The fundamental equation of Substrate X Theory:
```
∇⋅(s v_sub − D∇s + χ s u) + ∂s/∂t = αE + β∇⋅(E v_sub) + γF − σ_irr
```

Derived from four fundamental postulates:
1. Information conservation
2. Three-component information current (advection, diffusion, coherence)
3. Information production from energy
4. Irreversible information loss

*See `master-equation-origin.md` for analysis of mathematical structure and uniqueness.*

## Force Law Derivation
From master equation to F = k s v_sub
- See `core-equations.md` for the gravitational force law
- Derived from information pressure gradient in substrate

## Orbital Equations
From flow dynamics to orbital motion
- Radial acceleration: a_radial = -GM/r² - r θ̇²
- Tangential acceleration: a_theta = (θ̇ × v_flow) / r
- Substrate flow velocity: v_flow = -√(2GM/r)

## Rotation-Induced Decoherence
**Rigorous derivation**: See `rotation-decoherence-derivation.md`
- Result: Γ = Γ₀ + kω²
- Derived from Coriolis effect on information current in rotating frame
- Unique, testable prediction of Substrate X Theory

## Lorentz Invariance
**Rigorous proof**: See `lorentz-invariance-proof.md`
- Master equation written in covariant 4-vector form
- Proves theory is compatible with Special Relativity
- Resolves "ether problem" through covariant formulation
- Substrate flow constrained to v_sub < c (except at event horizons)
