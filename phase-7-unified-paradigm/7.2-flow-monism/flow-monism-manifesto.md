# Flow Monism: The Unified Paradigm

## The Fundamental Principle
**Reality = Substrate X + Information + Flow**

Everything that exists is dynamic processes in a universal information-carrying substrate.

## The Three Pillars of Flow Monism

### 1. Everything Flows
All phenomena are dynamic processes, not static objects. What we perceive as "things" are stable flow patterns.

### 2. Information is Substance  
Mind and matter are different manifestations of information patterns. Consciousness is coherent information; matter is stabilized information.

### 3. Connectivity is Fundamental
Separation is illusion. Everything interacts through the substrate. Non-locality is natural in an interconnected medium.

## Resolution of Ancient Dualities

### Mind-Body Problem
Both mind and body are substrate information patterns at different complexity levels.

### Wave-Particle Duality  
Different flow regime manifestations of the same underlying substrate dynamics.

### Determinism-Free Will
Deterministic substrate with emergent creativity and unpredictability.

## Implications for Human Experience

### Consciousness
Conscious awareness is the substrate becoming aware of itself through complex information processing.

### Purpose and Meaning  
Human purpose emerges from participating in cosmic information processing and pattern complexity growth.

### Ethics and Morality
Ethical frameworks derive naturally from fundamental interconnectedness - harming others is literally harming yourself.

## The Cosmic Perspective

### Universe as Information Processor
The cosmos is a self-organizing information processing system where complexity naturally increases.

### Evolution as Learning
Biological and cosmic evolution represent the substrate learning to process information more effectively.

### Destiny and Free Will
We have genuine creativity within deterministic constraints - like musicians improvising within musical scales.
