# Phase 7: Unified Paradigm

## Overview
The synthesis of Substrate X Theory into a complete worldview - integrating physics, consciousness, cosmology, and philosophy into a single coherent framework called **Flow Monism**. This phase represents the ultimate achievement: a unified understanding of reality from quantum to cosmic scales, from matter to mind.

## Directory Structure

### 7.1 Physics-Metaphysics Integration

- Material and spiritual unification
- Scientific methodology and mystical experience reconciliation
- Complete reality description across all domains

### 7.2 Flow Monism  
**The core philosophical framework**
