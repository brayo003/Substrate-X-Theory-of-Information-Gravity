Phase 7: Unified Interpretive Layer
Overview

Phase 7 consolidates the validated consequences of Substrate X Theory into a constrained philosophical interpretation framework. It does not introduce new physics, mechanisms, or claims of finality. All conclusions in this phase are contingent on the successful operation of earlier phases and are explicitly non-authoritative.

This layer exists to interpret—not extend—the theory.

Directory Structure
7.1 Physics–Experience Correspondence

Mapping validated physical dynamics to experiential analogs

Interpretation of information flow in perceptual and cognitive systems

Limits of subjective inference under substrate constraints

Explicit separation of measurable dynamics and lived experience

No new dynamics introduced.

7.2 Flow Monism (Interpretive Hypothesis)

A conditional philosophical framing

Single-substrate ontology as an interpretation of verified information dynamics

Information treated as a unifying descriptor, not a metaphysical substance

All claims reversible if upstream theory fails

This is a lens, not a law.

7.3 Implications and Boundaries

What follows—and what does not

Ethical considerations derived from interdependence under shared dynamics

Societal modeling implications under DCIF-classified regimes

Explicit rejection of teleology, destiny, or intrinsic cosmic purpose

Meaning is emergent, not imposed.

Status and Constraints

Epistemic Status: Interpretive only

Falsifiability: Indirect, via upstream failure

Authority Level: Lowest in the stack

Deletion Condition: Automatic if Phase 1–6 invalidated

Core Principle

Unity is inferred, not asserted.
Where structure ends, claims stop.
