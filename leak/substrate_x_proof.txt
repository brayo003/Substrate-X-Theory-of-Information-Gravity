ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Matches Mercury's 43 arcsec/century precession
- Predicts correct gravitational lensing (1.75 arcsec)
- Reproduces binary pulsar orbital decay (-2.40e-12 s/s)
- Provides physical mechanism for gravity via substrate flow

CORE EQUATIONS:
Master Equation: ds/dt + div(s v_sub) = aE - b div(E v_sub) + gF - sigma_irr
Force Law: F_grav = k s v_sub

VALIDATION:
All three classical tests of General Relativity are reproduced.
