The dynamics of Substrate X are Lorentz-invariant. There is no experiment an observer can do to measure their absolute motion through it; they will always measure themselves to be at rest with their local flow, and the speed of light to be constant



    Gravity emerges from Φ's flow dynamics

    Quantum mechanics emerges from Φ's information dynamics

    The measurement problem resolves through Φ's entropy dynamics

    Spacetime itself is the geometric manifestation of Φ's structure
