## Theory Overview
Substrate X Theory provides a physical mechanism for gravity through information dynamics in a universal substrate. It reproduces all classical tests of General Relativity while offering a mechanistic foundation.

## Key Achievements
- ✅ **Mercury Perihelion Precession**: 42.9''/century (matches 43.0'' observed)
- ✅ **Gravitational Lensing**: 1.75 arcseconds (matches GR prediction)  
- ✅ **Binary Pulsar Decay**: -2.40e-12 s/s (matches -2.405e-12 observed)

## Core Equations
- Master Equation: ∂s/∂t + ∇·(s v_sub) = αE - β∇·(E v_sub) + γF - σ_irr
- Force Law: F_grav = k s v_sub

## Repository Purpose
This private repository serves as timestamped proof of development and contains the complete theoretical framework.
