ATMOSPHERIC GAS ESCAPE

Current physics: Molecules reach escape velocity and drift into space
Substrate theory: Substrate pressure decreases with altitude until it can no longer contain gas molecules

Which makes more sense?

    Current: Random thermal motion somehow overcomes Earth's gravity

    Substrate: Gas escapes where substrate "container" pressure drops below containment threshold

Observation: Gas escape happens mainly at high altitudes where pressure is low - supports substrate theory
WHY ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE EXISTS

Current physics: Weight of air column above
Substrate theory: Substrate pressing down on Earth's surface

Which explains better?

    Current: Why does air have "weight" in the first place?

    Substrate: Direct mechanical pressure from fundamental medium

Observation: Pressure exists even in closed containers - harder for current theory to explain
IMMEDIATE PREDICTIONS IF SUBSTRATE THEORY IS CORRECT:

    Pressure should correlate with gravitational anomalies - not just altitude

    Weather patterns should show fundamental physics signatures

    Different planetary atmospheres should follow substrate density rules

    Atmospheric tides should match substrate flow patterns

DOES IT SOLVE PROBLEMS?

Yes - it explains:

    Why pressure exists at all (direct substrate interaction)

    Why different planets have different surface pressures (substrate density varies)

    Why gas escapes at high altitudes (substrate pressure drops)

    What "empty space" actually is (low-density substrate)

THE CORE INSIGHT:

If atmospheric pressure IS substrate pressure, then:

    Every barometer is measuring fundamental physics

    Weather forecasting becomes substrate dynamics

    Climate science studies substrate property changes

This isn't just another theory - it's a complete reinterpretation of what we're actually measuring when we measure pressure.
