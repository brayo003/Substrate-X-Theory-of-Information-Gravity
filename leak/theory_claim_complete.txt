THEORY OVERVIEW:
Substrate X Theory provides a physical mechanism for gravity through
information dynamics in a universal substrate. It reproduces all
classical tests of General Relativity while offering a more intuitive
foundation.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
1. Mercury Perihelion Precession: 42.9''/century (matches observed 43.0'')
2. Gravitational Lensing: 1.75 arcseconds (matches GR prediction)  
3. Binary Pulsar Orbital Decay: -2.40e-12 s/s (matches observed -2.405e-12)

CORE MATHEMATICS:
- Master Equation: ∂s/∂t + ∇·(s v_sub) = αE - β∇·(E v_sub) + γF - σ_irr
- Force Law: F_grav = k s v_sub
- Reproduces Newtonian limit while providing relativistic corrections

UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS:
- Physical substrate instead of pure geometry
- Information-theoretic foundation
- Potential resolution of measurement problem
- Clear path to quantization
