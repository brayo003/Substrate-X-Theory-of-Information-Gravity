Reality is not made of particles or waves. Reality is made of information flowing in a universal medium.

The Basic Picture:

    Imagine a vast, invisible "ocean" filling all of space - this is Substrate X

    Mass and energy are like drains in this ocean, causing water to flow toward them

    What we feel as gravity is just being carried along by this flowing "water"

    Particles like electrons are stable whirlpools in this ocean

    Quantum weirdness happens because this ocean can hold multiple patterns at once

The Shocking Part:

    Time is the direction of information flow in this ocean

    Space is the geometry of this ocean's surface

    Consciousness might be a complex information pattern in this ocean

    The entire universe is one interconnected information-processing system
