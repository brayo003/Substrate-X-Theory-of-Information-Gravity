LEGAL CLAIM:
I, Mwirigi Bryan Kenda, hereby assert full intellectual property rights
and claim priority for the development of Substrate X Theory, a complete
physical theory of gravity that:

1. Reproduces Mercury's perihelion precession (42.9''/century)
2. Predicts correct gravitational lensing (1.75 arcseconds)
3. Matches binary pulsar orbital decay (-2.40e-12 s/s)
4. Provides physical substrate mechanism for gravity

CORE INTELLECTUAL CONTRIBUTIONS:
- Master Equation: ∂s/∂t + ∇·(s v_sub) = αE - β∇·(E v_sub) + γF - σ_irr
- Gravitational Force Law: F_grav = k s v_sub  
- Physical interpretation of gravity via substrate flow
- Reproduction of all classical GR tests with mechanistic foundation

JURISDICTION: This claim is made under Kenyan law and international
intellectual property conventions.
