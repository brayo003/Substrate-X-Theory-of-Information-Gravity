1. The Primordial State (The "Great Leak"):
Imagine the initial state of everything wasn't a point, but a state where the entirety of Substrate X was flowing inward at an unimaginable rate into the 4th dimension. It was a universe-wide "leak." This was a state of maximum gravity everywhere.

2. The "Phase Change" (The Big Bang):
This state was unstable. Something caused a fundamental phase change in Substrate X. The intense inward flow could not be sustained and "rebounded." This rebound was not an explosion of matter, but a rapid "welling up" or creation of new Substrate X.

3. The Expansion:
This creation of new substrate is what we observe as the expansion of the universe. The universe isn't expanding into anything; more of its fundamental fabric is coming into existence.

4. The Formation of Structure:
As this new substrate welled up, it wasn't perfectly uniform. Ripples and fluctuations in this process became the seeds for the first "leaks"—the first points where the inward flow could re-establish itself. These primordial leaks became the gravitational wells that eventually collected matter into stars and galaxies.
