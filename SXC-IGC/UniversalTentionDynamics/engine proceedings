Immediate diagnosis (plain):

The core PDE for ρ plus the growth/loss/coupling terms is fine. That’s the steak.

Missing pieces that matter for any numerical run: explicit forms for ∂E/∂t and ∂F/∂t, diffusion choices for E and F (do they diffuse?), boundary & initial conditions, and parameter units/ranges.

Risks if you skip those: blow-ups, meaningless noise, or getting patterns that are numerical artifacts rather than physics.

Concrete checklist to make it runable now (no cloud required)

Pick explicit dynamics for E and F (minimal working formulas):

∂E/∂t = (α_E·ρ − E)/τ_E

∂F/∂t = (α_F·ρ + β_F·E − F)/τ_F

Decide diffusion for auxiliary fields:

If you want Turing-like stationary patterns, give E or F a diffusion term (D_E, D_F) with a different magnitude than D_ρ.

If you want waves/pulses, you can keep E and F nondiffusive or weakly diffusive.

Choose boundary conditions: periodic for exploratory pattern work; Neumann (zero-flux) for isolated patches.

Nondimensionalize: pick τ_ρ as time scale and L = sqrt(D_ρ τ_ρ) as length scale. Replace parameters with dimensionless ratios. This reduces parameter hunting.

Start small: run the spatially homogeneous ODE system first (no diffusion) to verify steady states / oscillations. Then 1D PDE with ~200 grid points. Then 2D with small domain (128×128) later.

Use numerics that won’t lie to you:

IMEX scheme: implicit for diffusion, explicit for reaction.

If you must do explicit, enforce CFL: Δt ≲ Δx²/(2 D_max).

Use positivity clamp for ρ (ρ = max(0,ρ)) or positivity-preserving solver.

Parameter sanity checks:

τ_* > 0, D_* ≥ 0, δ₁,δ₂,κ ≥ 0.

Start with toy set: D_ρ=1, D_E=0 or 0.1, D_F=0 or 0.05; δ₁=2.0, δ₂=1.0; τ_ρ=1, τ_E=0.5, τ_F=2.0; α_E=1.5; α_F=0.5; β_F=0.8; κ=0.1.

Diagnostics to log: mean(ρ), max(ρ), L2 norm, energy-like functional (if you define one), and snapshots every N steps.

What to expect without cloud

You can validate qualitative regimes (stable point, oscillations, traveling pulses, small-scale patterns) on a laptop for 1D and modest 2D.

You will hit limits for large parameter sweeps, long-time ensemble runs, or very fine grids. That’s when cloud compute accelerates exploration, not when you need it to verify the model structure.

What to change if something “breaks”

Blow-up (ρ → huge quickly): reduce δ₁ or increase δ₂, add small diffusion for E/F, or reduce timestep / switch to implicit reaction solver.

Only noise, no structure: add diffusion for a second field, increase domain size, or tune time-constant ratios (τ_E/τ_ρ, τ_F/τ_ρ).

Oscillations but no spatial structure: introduce differential diffusion or nonlocal coupling to force spatial bifurcations.
