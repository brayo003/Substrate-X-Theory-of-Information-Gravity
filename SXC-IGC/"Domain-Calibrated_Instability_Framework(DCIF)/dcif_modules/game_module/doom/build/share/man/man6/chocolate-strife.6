.SH IWAD SEARCH PATHS
To play, an IWAD file is needed.
This is a large file containing all of the levels, graphics,
sound effects, music and other material that make up the game.
IWAD files are named according to the game; the standard names are:
.TP
.IR doom.wad ,\~\c
.IR doom1.wad ,\~\c
.IR doom2.wad ,\~\c
.IR tnt.wad ,\~\c
.I plutonia.wad
Doom, Doom II, Final Doom
.TP
.IR heretic.wad ,\~\c
.IR hexen.wad ,\~\c
.I strife.wad
Heretic, Hexen and Strife (commercial Doom engine games).
.TP
.IR hacx.wad ,\~\c
.I chex.wad
Hacx and Chex Quest - more obscure games based on the Doom engine.
.TP
.IR freedm.wad ,\~\c
.IR freedoom1.wad ,\~\c
.I freedoom2.wad
The Freedoom open content IWAD files.
.LP
The following directory paths are searched in order to find an IWAD:
.TP
Current working directory
Any IWAD files found in the current working directory will be used in
preference to IWADs found in any other directories.
.TP
.I DOOMWADDIR
This environment variable can be set to contain a path to a single
directory in which to look for IWAD files.
This environment variable is supported by most Doom source ports.
.TP
.I DOOMWADPATH
This environment variable, if set, can contain a colon-separated list of
directories in which to look for IWAD files, or alternatively full paths to
specific IWAD files.
.TP
.I $HOME/.local/share/games/doom
Writeable directory in the user's home directory.
The path can be overridden using the
.I \%XDG_DATA_HOME
environment variable (see the XDG Base Directory Specification).
.TP
.I /usr/local/share/doom
.TQ
.I /usr/local/share/games/doom
.TQ
.I /usr/share/doom
.TQ
.I /usr/share/games/doom
System-wide locations that can be accessed by all users.
The path
.I /usr/share/games/doom
is a standard path that is supported by most Doom source ports.
These paths can be overridden using the
.I \%XDG_DATA_DIRS
environment variable (see the XDG Base Directory Specification).
.LP
The above can be overridden on a one-time basis by using the
.B \-iwad
command line parameter to provide the path to an IWAD file to use.This
parameter can also be used to specify the name of a particular IWAD to use
from one of the above paths.
For example,
.RB \(lq "\-iwad doom.wad" \(rq
will search the above paths for the file
.I doom.wad
to use.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
This section describes environment variables that control
Chocolate Strife's behavior.
.TP
.I DOOMWADDIR
.TQ
.I DOOMWADPATH
See section \(lqIWAD SEARCH PATHS\(rq above.
.TP
.I PCSOUND_DRIVER
When running in PC speaker sound effect mode, this environment variable
specifies a PC speaker driver to use for sound effect playback.
Valid options are
.RB \(lq Linux \(rq
for the Linux console mode driver,
.RB \(lq BSD \(rq
for the NetBSD/OpenBSD PC speaker driver,
and
.RB \(lq SDL \(rq
for SDL-based emulated PC speaker playback (using the digital output).
.TP
.I OPL_DRIVER
When using OPL MIDI playback, this environment variable specifies an
OPL backend driver to use.
Valid options are
.RB \(lq SDL \(rq
for an SDL-based software emulated OPL chip,
.RB \(lq Linux \(rq
for the Linux hardware OPL driver,
and
.RB \(lq OpenBSD \(rq
for the OpenBSD/NetBSD hardware OPL driver.
.IP
Generally speaking, a real hardware OPL chip sounds better than software
emulation; however, modern machines do not often include one.
If present, it may still require extra work to set up and elevated
security privileges to access.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I $HOME/.local/share/chocolate\-doom/strife.cfg
The main configuration file for Chocolate Strife.
See \fBstrife.cfg\fR(5).
.TP
.I $HOME/.local/share/chocolate\-doom/chocolate\-strife.cfg
Extra configuration values that are specific to Chocolate
Strife and not present in Vanilla Strife.
See \fBchocolate\-strife.cfg\fR(5).
.SH SEE ALSO

.SH HISTORY
The source code for Strife was lost, which means, unlike the code for
all the other commercial games using the Doom engine, it cannot be
released.
The only access we have to the code is the binary executable file.
Reverse engineering tools were employed to disassemble and decompile the
executables, which were cross-referenced against the Linux Doom and
DOS Heretic sources and painstakingly combed over multiple times,
instruction by instruction, to ensure that the resulting
Chocolate-Doom-based executable is as close as possible to the original.
.SH LEGALITY
Reverse engineering is a protected activity so long as the original code
is not used directly in the product.
Due to the vast amount of information lost through the process of
compilation, and the need to refactor large portions of code in order to
eliminate non-portable idioms or to adapt them properly to Chocolate
Doom's framework, the resulting code behaves the same, but is not the
.I same
code.
.PP
In addition, James Monroe and John Carmack have both stated that they
have no objections to the project.
Because they are the original authors of the code, and neither Rogue nor
their publisher, Velocity, Inc., exist any longer as legal entities,
this is effectively legal permission.
.SH BUGS
Chocolate Strife is almost, but not entirely perfect, in
recreating the behavior of Vanilla Strife.
Help us by reporting any discrepancies you might notice between this
executable and the vanilla DOS program.
.PP
However, do
.I not
report any glitch that you can replicate in the vanilla EXE as a bug.
The point of Chocolate Strife, like Chocolate Doom before it,
is to be as bug-compatible with the original game as possible.
Also be aware that some glitches are impossible to compatibly recreate,
and wherever this is the case, Chocolate Strife has erred on
the side of not crashing the program, for example by initializing
pointers to
.I NULL
rather than using them without setting a value first.
.SH AUTHORS
Chocolate Strife is part of the Chocolate Doom project.
It was reverse engineered from the DOS versions of Strife by James Haley
and Samuel Villarreal.
Chocolate Doom was written and maintained by Simon Howard, and is based
on the LinuxDoom source code released by Id Software.
