We present SXC-IGC, a framework that detects systemic stress 
2-3 seconds before traditional market indicators (VIX). During 
crisis events, our system triggers automated controls (FIREWALL) 
that reduce systemic tension by 24% while market panic continues 
to increase by 652%. This reveals a fundamental "detection-control 
gap" where automated systems can intervene faster than human 
markets can react.
