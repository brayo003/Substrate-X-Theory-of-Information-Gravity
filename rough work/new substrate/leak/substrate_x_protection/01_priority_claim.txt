SUBSTRATE X THEORY - PRIORITY CLAIM
====================================

I hereby claim priority for the development of Substrate X Theory,
a physical theory of gravity that:

1. Reproduces Mercury's perihelion precession (42.9''/century)
2. Predicts correct gravitational lensing (1.75 arcseconds)  
3. Matches binary pulsar orbital decay (-2.40e-12 s/s)
4. Provides physical substrate mechanism for gravity

CORE INSIGHT: Gravity emerges from information dynamics in a
universal substrate, described by the master equation:

∂s/∂t + ∇·(s v_sub) = αE - β∇·(E v_sub) + γF - σ_irr

This represents a fundamental alternative to the geometric
interpretation of General Relativity.
