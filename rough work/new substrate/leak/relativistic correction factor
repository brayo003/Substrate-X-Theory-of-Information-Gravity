1. The Time Dilation Factor

The time dilation factor utilized by the Substrate X model is:
Λ(r)=dτdt​=1−rc22GM​​1​

2. The Redshift Calculation

The redshift z for a photon escaping from a massive object (radius re​) to an observer at infinity (ro​→∞) is given by:
z=Λ(re​)1​−1

Substituting the Λ(r) factor from the Substrate X model yields:
z=1−re​c22GM​​−1

3. Comparison and Conclusion

The model's prediction is summarized by the table below:
Celestial Body / Effect	Substrate X Prediction	Accepted Value / Effect	Result
Sun Surface Redshift	2.12×10−6	≈2.12×10−6	✅ PASS (Exact Match)
Earth Surface Redshift	6.95×10−10	Confirms time dilation over height difference	✅ PASS
GPS Satellite Timing	Predicts ∼45 microseconds/day difference	Matches observed clock rate difference	✅ PASS
