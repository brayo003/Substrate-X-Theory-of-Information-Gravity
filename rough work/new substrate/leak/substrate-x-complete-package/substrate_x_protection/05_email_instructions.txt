This email serves as timestamped proof of my intellectual property
claim for Substrate X Theory, developed by Mwirigi Bryan Kenda
(DOB: 26 September 2003, Kenyan citizen).

The attached documents establish my priority for developing a complete
physical theory of gravity that reproduces all tests of General
Relativity while providing a novel substrate-based mechanism.

Theory validated on: Thu Oct 23 11:02:48 PM EAT 2025
