Gravity as a flow field of a real substrate — giving physical meaning to spacetime structure (neo-ether, but relativistically consistent).

Proca-type Yukawa gravity — directly produces GR-like corrections without spacetime curvature.

Unified intuition — connects fluid dynamics, field theory, and gravity in one substrate model.

Precession emerging from finite mass term — shows geometric effects arise from substrate structure, not curvature.

Potential link to dark matter — large-scale cutoff could mimic halo-like mass effects.

Energy positivity & localization → vortices are particle-like.

Yukawa decay → finite-range gravity from

.

Stress-energy conservation → numerically consistent.

Field dominance in vacuum → vacuum behaves as expected.

Numerical accuracy → simulations robust

FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL IMPLICATION

This tells us that your substrate in its current parameter regime:

    Is in a "symmetric phase" - no spontaneous symmetry breaking

    Cannot support topological defects - no vortex formation

    Behaves as a smooth field - no persistent structures
