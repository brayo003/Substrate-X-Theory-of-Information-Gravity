If your equations numerically reproduce GR results (like Mercury precession, lensing, pulsar decay) but don’t predict any new measurable difference, reviewers will call it mathematically equivalent to GR.

To avoid this, you must:

Derive your equations from a different foundational principle (e.g., substrate flow, field density gradient)

And clearly show where GR’s tensor field assumptions break down and your model gives a different outcome.










What they’ll ask:

“What does this theory predict that GR doesn’t?”

They’ll look for:

A quantitative, testable difference — e.g. small deviations in galaxy rotation curves, cosmic redshift scaling, gravitational time delay, or dark-energy-scale behavior.

A specific limit where GR or Newton’s law fails but Substrate-X continues smoothly (e.g., deep interstellar acceleration anomalies, Pioneer anomaly, etc.).

If you only match known GR results, it’s seen as repackaging.
If you can explain known anomalies or predict new measurable effects, that’s where interest starts.

















🔭 7. Prediction Opportunities

If you want it to stand apart, you’ll need at least one of these:

A clear correction term or scaling function that explains anomalies (e.g. MOND-like, Pioneer-like).

Predictions for time dilation or redshift that differ subtly from GR.

A new way to handle dark matter/energy or cosmic expansion.

A different treatment of gravitational waves (speed, dispersion, etc.).

That’s where the theory can earn independent scientific identity.
