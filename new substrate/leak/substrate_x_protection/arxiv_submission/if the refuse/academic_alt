# ACADEMIC PRIORITY PLATFORMS - IF ARXIV REJECTS

## IMMEDIATE ALTERNATIVES (Same Day):
1. **ResearchGate** - Upload as "Preprint"
   - URL: researchgate.net
   - Public, timestamped, academic audience
   - Almost instant publication

2. **Zenodo** (CERN's repository)
   - URL: zenodo.org  
   - Gets DOI number (official academic ID)
   - Permanent, citable record

3. **OSF Preprints** 
   - URL: osf.io/preprints
   - Academic-focused, respected platform

4. **viXra** (Alternative to arXiv)
   - URL: vixra.org
   - Less strict, but still establishes priority

## STRATEGIC APPROACH:
- Upload to MULTIPLE platforms simultaneously
- Different timestamps create overlapping proof
- No single gatekeeper can block your work
