Γ = Γ₀ + kω²
k = 4.5 × 10⁻⁷ s

QUESTION:
Does quantum decoherence increase with rotation rate squared?

EXPERIMENT:

    Take trapped ion/qubit

    Put on rotating stage

    Measure coherence time at different rotation speeds

    Check if Γ ∝ ω²

PREDICTION:
100 rad/s → ΔΓ = 4.5 × 10⁻³ s⁻¹
200 rad/s → ΔΓ = 1.8 × 10⁻² s⁻¹

TESTABLE NOW with existing quantum computers + rotation stages
