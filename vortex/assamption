 Test 1: First-Order Analytical Derivation of Vortex Kinetic Energy

We assume a stable, massive object (the galactic center) induces a long-range, 1/r substrate flow v


sub

​ via the Proca-GP coupling. This flow is the Dark Matter energy.


Step 1: Simplify the Stress-Energy Tensor (Tμν

​)

We focus on the contribution of the substrate's kinetic energy to the effective mass density, ρflow

​. This comes from the T00

​ component of the field's stress-energy tensor (Tfield

μν

​) in the non-relativistic limit.

The T00

​ term is the total energy density ρX

​.

The relevant mass contribution is the Kinetic Energy Density (ρflow

where ρ0

Step 2: Propose the Vortex Solution (First-Order GP)

Based on established solutions for irrotational flow induced by a massive object in a superfluid (Bose-Einstein Condensate), the velocity field far from the core (r≫rcore

​) is:


∣v


sub

​(r)∣=2πr


Γ

​

where Γ is the circulation (analogous to the angular momentum of the substrate vortex).


Step 3: Compute the Kinetic Energy Density (ρflow

Substitute the vortex flow solution into the energy density expression:

This expression demonstrates that the vortex flow creates an energy density that decays as 1/r2

.


Step 4: Derive the Force and Circular Velocity

For spherical symmetry, the velocity of a test particle vcirc

​ is related to the enclosed mass/energy M(r) by:


vcirc

​(r)=r


GM(r)

​

The total enclosed mass Mflow

​(r) from the substrate flow is found by integrating the density ρflow

​(r) over a sphere of radius r:

Now, substitute Mflow

​(r) into the circular velocity equation:

​(r)=4πGCvortex

​


Step 5: Analysis of the Result

​



​=Constant


Prediction: The circular velocity is independent of radius r.

Observational Match: This result perfectly matches the defining observational characteristic of Dark Matter—the flat galactic rotation curve observed far outside the luminous matter distribution.

Conclusion

The analytical first-order derivation confirms that the Vortex Flow Mechanism built into the SXC-IGC framework is capable of generating the required ρ∝1/r2

 mass profile necessary to produce a constant circular velocity for galaxies. This successfully resolves the conflict posed by the static Yukawa term.
