Paper Structure: "From Stochastic Tension Dynamics to Dynamical Dark Energy"
Abstract

We present a novel dynamical dark energy model derived from stochastic tension dynamics observed in complex systems. Starting from a discrete cubic nonlinear map exhibiting critical behavior at a specific parameter value (r = 0.153267), we derive a relativistic scalar field theory with a double-well potential. This field naturally evolves from an unstable symmetric phase to a stable broken-symmetry vacuum, providing a dynamical explanation for cosmic acceleration. The model predicts scale-dependent structure growth testable by upcoming surveys and offers a unique connection between microscopic stochastic processes and cosmological evolution.
1. Introduction
1.1 The Dark Energy Problem

    Current status: ΛCDM successes and tensions (H₀, σ₈, A_L)

    Motivation for dynamical dark energy

    Limitations of ad-hoc potentials

1.2 Critical Phenomena in Complex Systems

    Tension dynamics in social/ecological/technological systems

    The universal cubic nonlinearity: ẋ = rx + ax² - bx³ + noise

    Critical point at r = 0.153267: 50% tipping probability

1.3 From Microscopic Dynamics to Cosmology

    Hypothesis: Similar dynamics govern spacetime at large scales

2. Mathematical Derivation: From Discrete Map to Scalar Field
2.1 The Stochastic Tension Equation
text

x_{n+1} = x_n + Δt(r x_n + a x_n² - b x_n³) + η_n
η_n ~ N(0, σ²), r = 0.153267, a = 1.0, b = 1.0

2.2 Continuum Limit and Field Theory
text

∂_t s = D∇²s + rs + as² - bs³ + ξ(x,t)  [Stochastic PDE]
→ □s + V'(s) = 0  [Relativistic scalar field]
V(s) = κ(-½rs² - a/3 s³ + b/4 s⁴)  [Double-well potential]

2.3 Critical Parameters and Physical Interpretation

    r = 0.153267 → m_s² = -r (negative mass squared → symmetry breaking)

    a = -1/3, b = 1/4 from original coefficients

    κ = 3.5×10⁻¹²² to match observed dark energy density

3. Cosmological Model
3.1 Action and Field Equations
text

S = ∫d⁴x√{-g}[½(∂s)² - V(s)] + S_matter
s̈ + 3Hṡ + V'(s) = 0
H² = (8πG/3)(ρ_m + ρ_r + ρ_s)

3.2 Background Evolution

    Numerical solution from z = 1000 to z = 0

    s-field evolves from s ≈ 0 (unstable) to s ≈ 1.135 (stable minimum)

    Equation of state: w(a) = (½ṡ² - V)/(½ṡ² + V)

3.3 Linear Perturbations
text

δ̈_s + 3Hδ̇_s + (k²/a² + V'')δ_s = -½ḣṡ
G_eff/G = 1 + (2β²k²)/(3(k² + a²m_s²))  [Scale-dependent growth]

6. Discussion
6.1 Theoretical Implications

    Dark energy as a symmetry-breaking phase transition

    Connection between microscopic stochasticity and cosmic evolution

    Natural explanation for why w ≈ -1 today

6.2 Comparison with Other Models

    Unlike quintessence: potential derived from dynamics, not postulated

    Similar to emergent gravity but with different microscopic origin
