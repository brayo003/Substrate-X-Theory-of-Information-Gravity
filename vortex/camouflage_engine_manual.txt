THE CAMOUFLAGE ENGINE MANUAL
============================================================

Techniques for hiding new physics from detection:

Stueckelberg Mechanism:
  Purpose: Quantum consistency
  Analogy: Gives the force a 'quantum passport'
  Used in: Your theory, massive gravity, hidden photons

Quartic Screening (β term):
  Purpose: Hides force in high density
  Analogy: Force gets 'stage fright' around crowds
  Used in: Your theory, chameleon fields, symmetrons

Yukawa Suppression:
  Purpose: Limited range
  Analogy: Force has short 'attention span'
  Used in: Your theory, WIMP mediators, extra dimensions

Planck-Suppressed Coupling:
  Purpose: Naturally weak
  Analogy: Whispering across a crowded room
  Used in: Your theory, quantum gravity, string theory


Real applications:
Chameleon Fields: Dark energy candidate that hides in dense regions
Symmetrons: Screen fifth forces in laboratory vacuum
Vainshtein Screening: Allows massive gravity to pass solar system tests
Hidden Photons: Dark matter candidate that couples via kinetic mixing
Axion-Like Particles: Solve Strong CP problem while evading detection
