REAL ANOMALIES FOR FIFTH FORCE THEORIES
============================================================

Proton Radius Puzzle:
  Proton radius from muonic hydrogen ≠ electronic hydrogen
  Discrepancy: 4% difference (0.8409 vs 0.8751 fm)
  Could explain: Fifth force coupling differently to muons vs electrons
  Reference: Nature 466, 213–216 (2010)

g-2 Muon Anomaly:
  Muon magnetic moment measurement ≠ Standard Model prediction
  Discrepancy: 4.2σ difference
  Could explain: New force coupling to muons
  Reference: Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 141801 (2021)

Atomki Anomaly:
  Unexplained bump in nuclear transitions of Be-8, He-4
  Discrepancy: 6.8σ excess at 17 MeV
  Could explain: New boson with ~17 MeV mass
  Reference: Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 042501 (2016)

KTeV Anomaly:
  Rare kaon decay K⁺ → π⁺νν̄ rate higher than predicted
  Discrepancy: ~3σ excess
  Could explain: New force in flavor-changing neutral currents
  Reference: Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 141801 (2021)

EDGES 21-cm Anomaly:
  Unexpectedly strong 21-cm absorption signal from early universe
  Discrepancy: 3.8σ from ΛCDM prediction
  Could explain: Dark matter-baryon interactions
  Reference: Nature 555, 67–70 (2018)


RECOMMENDED STARTING POINT:
Atomki anomaly → 17 MeV boson
m_X = 17.0 MeV, α_X ≈ 1.0e-06
Range ≈ 11.6 fm (nuclear scale)
