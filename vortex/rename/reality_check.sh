echo "1. WHY should this force exist?"
echo "   - Does it solve any known problem?"
echo "   - Does it follow from deeper principles?"
echo "   - Or is it just mathematically possible?"

echo "2. WHAT would change if it's real?"
echo "   - Would it affect technology? (Probably not)"
echo "   - Would it explain mysteries? (No)"
echo "   - Would it unify physics? (No)"

echo "   - Nature rarely hides physics so completely"
echo "   - Most fundamental forces have cosmic effects"
