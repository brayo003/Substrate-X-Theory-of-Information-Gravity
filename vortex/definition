Title: Tensions in a Two-Sector Unification of Solar System Gravity and Galactic Dynamics

Abstract: We attempt to unify Solar System constraints and galaxy rotation curves by combining a short-range Proca field (Sector A) with a superfluid dark matter sector (Sector B). We derive parameter constraints from both regimes and find they are incompatible without extreme fine-tuning. This highlights the challenges facing unified dark matter/gravity theories.
