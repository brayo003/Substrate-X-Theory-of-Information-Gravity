THE VISIBILITY FLOOR ANALYSIS
============================================================

Floor sensitivity: 2.3e-17 N at 1 mm
Improvement needed: 43.5×
Time to reach: ~16.4 years

Scientific implications:
1. Defines the resolution limit of fifth-force searches
2. Guides future experimental design
3. Separates 'testable physics' from 'mathematical possibilities'
4. Provides null hypothesis for anomaly detection
