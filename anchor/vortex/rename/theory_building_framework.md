# Theory Building Framework for New Physics

## Step 1: Find a Real Problem
- Actual experimental anomaly (>3σ)
- Theoretical inconsistency
- Unexplained observation

## Step 2: Build Minimal Model
- Add fewest new fields
- Respect known symmetries
- Ensure mathematical consistency

## Step 3: Derive Parameters from Data
- Don't pick numbers arbitrarily
- Use dimensional analysis
- Fit to the anomaly

## Step 4: Check Everything
- All experimental constraints
- Theoretical consistency (renormalizability, unitarity)
- Astrophysical/cosmological effects

## Step 5: Make Testable Predictions
- Specific experiments
- Timeline for testing
- Falsification criteria

## Step 6: Connect to Deeper Physics
- Why should this exist?
- How does it unify with known physics?
- What symmetries are involved?

## Common Pitfalls
- **Parameter fitting**: Don't just fit numbers - derive from principles
- **Ignoring constraints**: Check ALL experiments, not just favorable ones
- **Moving goalposts**: Don't change theory after negative results
- **No falsifiability**: Theory must be testable and could be wrong
- **No motivation**: Why should this exist? Connect to deeper physics
- **Overcomplicating**: Start simple, add complexity only if needed
- **Island theory**: Connect to other physics, don't exist in isolation
