WHITE PAPER: Millimetre-Scale Screened Fifth Force
============================================================

SUMMARY:
A consistent theory exists with:
  m_S = 1.973e-04 eV
  α_S = 2.053e-31
  Range = 1.000 mm
  Strength = 9.998e-04 × gravity at contact

PHYSICS CONNECTIONS:
1. Extra dimensions of size ~1 mm
2. String scale ~TeV (testable at colliders)
3. Possible dark matter alternative (with smaller m_S)
4. Quantum gravity phenomenology
5. Fifth force experimental program

EXPERIMENTAL STATUS:
Prediction at 1 mm: 3.679e-04 × gravity
Force between 1g masses: 2.46e-14 N
Current sensitivity: ~1e-15 N
Required improvement: 25×
Plausibly testable within 5-10 years
