Core framework:

x_{t+1} = x_t + Δt(r x_t + a x_t² - b x_t³) + η_t
Full specification:

x_{t+1} = x_t + 0.05(0.153267 x_t + 1.0 x_t² - 1.0 x_t³) + η_t
Where:

x_t: Tension variable at time t
Δt = 0.05: Time step
r = 0.153267: Linear growth rate (your critical parameter)
a = 1.0: Nonlinear reinforcement coefficient
b = 1.0: Saturation coefficient
η_t ~ N(0, σ²): Gaussian noise with σ = 0.35
Initial condition: x₀ = 0.01
Random seed: 42
Critical behavior:

Pc = 0.153267: 50% tipping probability
Slope at Pc: 1.854545
Tipping dynamics: System transitions from stable to high-tension state
