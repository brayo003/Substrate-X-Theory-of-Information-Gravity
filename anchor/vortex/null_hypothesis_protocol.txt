NULL HYPOTHESIS PROTOCOL FOR FIFTH-FORCE SEARCHES
======================================================================

Null theory parameters:
m_S = 1.973e-4 eV
α_S = 6.324e-35
β = 1.0

Predicted signal: 2.3e-17 N at 1 mm (1g masses)

Experimental protocol:

BLIND ANALYSIS PROTOCOL:

1. PRE-REGISTER prediction:
   "Our null hypothesis is a screened fifth force with:
    m_S = 1.973e-4 eV, α_S = 6.324e-35, β = 1.0
    Predicted signal: 2.3e-17 N at 1 mm"

2. COLLECT DATA (blinded):
   - Hide true distances with offsets
   - Encrypt force readings
   - Lock true parameters

3. ANALYSIS (blind):
   - Fit data to your theory + systematic model
   - Extract best-fit parameters
   - Calculate χ²

4. UNBLINDING:
   - If extracted α_S ≈ 6.324e-35: Null confirmed
   - If α_S > 6.324e-35: New physics candidate!
   - If α_S < 6.324e-35: Better limits than expected

5. INTERPRETATION:
   - Null confirmed → Experiment working, no new physics
   - Deviation found → Check systematics, then claim discovery


Interpretation guide:
- α_S measured ≈ 6.324e-35 → Null confirmed
- α_S measured > 6.324e-35 → New physics candidate
- α_S measured < 6.324e-35 → Better limits than null
