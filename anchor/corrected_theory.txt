# CORRECTED SUBSTRATE X THEORY
# ============================

PROBLEM: Original A was 10^10 too large

CORRECTED SCALE:
  From pendulum data: γ/β ≈ 0.001 s⁻¹ at Earth
  Your α = 0.016 (weak density dependence)
  Corrected A = 9.97e-04

NEW EQUATION:
  γ/β = 9.97e-04 × ρ^0.016

PREDICTIONS:
  Deep space (Pioneer): ρ = 1.4e-16 → γ/β = 5.56e-04 s⁻¹
  Pulsar environment: ρ = 1.0e-21 → γ/β = 4.60e-04 s⁻¹
  LIGO path: ρ = 1.0e-27 → γ/β = 3.69e-04 s⁻¹
  ISS orbit: ρ = 1.0e-12 → γ/β = 6.41e-04 s⁻¹
  Earth sea level: ρ = 1.2e+00 → γ/β = 1.00e-03 s⁻¹
  Laboratory vacuum: ρ = 1.0e-10 → γ/β = 6.90e-04 s⁻¹

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:
  • Universal background damping
  • Nearly constant everywhere (varies only ~2×)
  • Pioneer: substrate contributes ~1372997711670.5% of anomaly
  • Matches pendulum Q factors
