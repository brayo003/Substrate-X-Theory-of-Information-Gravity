# DANGEROUS THEORY: UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CONSTANT
# ==============================================

CORE IDEA:
  γ/β = 1.000e-03 s⁻¹ (everywhere, always)
  α = 0.016 (varies only 3.4× across universe)

PHYSICAL MEANING:
  The universe has a FUNDAMENTAL DAMPING CONSTANT
  All oscillators have minimum damping rate Γ_min = γ/β
  All Q factors have maximum Q_max = ω/(γβ)

EVIDENCE:
  1. Pioneer residual (after thermal)
  2. Pendulum floor (after air friction)
  3. Universal τ_max ~ 1000 s for mechanical oscillators

TESTABLE PREDICTIONS:
  1. NO oscillator can have τ > ~1000 seconds
  2. NO system can have Q > ω × 1000
  3. Identical oscillators on Earth/space: same τ

IMPLICATIONS:
  • New fundamental constant
  • Limit on all precision measurements
  • Background field affecting everything
  • Revolutionary if true
