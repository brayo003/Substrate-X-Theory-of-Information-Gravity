# COMPLETE SUBSTRATE X THEORY
# ===========================

FUNDAMENTAL EQUATION:
  T = βE - γ(ρ)F

DERIVED DENSITY DEPENDENCE:
  γ(ρ) = γ₀ × (ρ/ρ₀)^0.016
  with α = 0.016 from data

PHYSICAL ORIGIN OF α:
  Screening length: λ ∝ ρ^0.492
  Collective interactions give α = 1 - 2δ = 0.016
  Screening: λ decreases with density

MEASURED PARAMETERS:
  A = 2.70e-16 (γ/β = Aρ^α)
  ρ₀ = 5.19e-22 kg/m³ (reference density)
  γ₀/β = 1.21e-16 s⁻¹

FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS TO DETERMINE:
  β = elastic coupling coefficient [s/J]
  γ₀ = baseline damping coefficient [J/m]
  Related by: γ₀ = β × A × ρ₀^0.016

TESTABLE PREDICTIONS:
  Laboratory (vacuum): ρ = 1.0e-10 → γ/β = 1.85e-16 s⁻¹
  Earth atmosphere (sea level): ρ = 1.2e+00 → γ/β = 2.71e-16 s⁻¹
  ISS orbit: ρ = 1.0e-12 → γ/β = 1.72e-16 s⁻¹
  Jupiter orbit: ρ = 1.0e-17 → γ/β = 1.43e-16 s⁻¹
  Kuiper Belt: ρ = 1.0e-19 → γ/β = 1.32e-16 s⁻¹
  Oort Cloud: ρ = 1.0e-23 → γ/β = 1.14e-16 s⁻¹

CRITICAL LAB TEST:
  Air at sea level (ρ = 1.2 kg/m³):
  γ/β = 2.71e-16 s⁻¹
  For v = 0.1 m/s: a_damp = 2.71e-17 m/s²
  This should be measurable!
