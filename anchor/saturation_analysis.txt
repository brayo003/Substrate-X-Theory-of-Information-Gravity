# SUBSTRATE X: DENSITY DEPENDENCE WITH SATURATION
# ===============================================

OBSERVATION: η ∝ ρ^b works at low densities but fails at high ρ

DATA:
  Solar System: ρ = 1.41e-16, η = 5.31e-02
  Galactic Disk: ρ = 1.00e-21, η = 1.85e-02
  Cosmic Void: ρ = 1.00e-27, η = 3.82e-16

POWER LAW FIT (low density):
  η = 2.771e+21 × ρ^1.2961
  R² = 0.8099, p = 2.8719e-01

PROBLEM: Extrapolation to lab gives η ≈ 2.71e+25
  This is physically impossible

SOLUTION: Saturation model η = η_max × [ρ/(ρ + ρ_sat)]^b
  Fit: η_max = 0.7827, ρ_sat = 7.15e-11, b = 0.2114

PREDICTION: η saturates at ~0.01-0.1 for ρ > 10⁻¹⁶ kg/m³
  Constant in solar system, planetary atmospheres
  Test with: Cassini, atmospheric density variations

CRITICAL TEST:
  Measure η at different altitudes (density variation)
  Spacecraft at different solar distances
  Laboratory with variable pressure/density
